/* ---- ⚠️ SAMPLE COUNTS ARE DERIVED FROM THE TICK, NOT WRITTEN AS LITERALS ----
 * The first version hard-coded 6 and 14 and reasoned about them as "a third of a
 * second" and "~0.8 s", sized against the 56 ms console PRINT cadence. But this
 * machine is ticked once per CONTROL tick -- 8 ms -- and sp1_controls_scan() produces

 * 7x shorter than intended.
 *
 * That is the actual reason two partial presses were captured as complete: the
 * "longer settle" meant to let a second finger land was a tenth of a second. Derive
 * the counts from the real period so the intent survives a change to SP1_TICK_MS. */
