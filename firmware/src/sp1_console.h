/*
 * wakes-sp1 — USB CDC ACM console.
 *
 * Exists mainly to make two things possible that are miserable blind:
 *   1. calibrating the battery divider (see sp1_batt.h)
 *   2. building the button-ladder threshold tables in M1d, which means watching
 *      raw ADC values while pressing buttons and combinations
 *
 * ⚠️ NEVER call into this from the audio path once M2 lands. printk over CDC ACM
 * can block for milliseconds when a host is attached and the endpoint is busy.
 * The audio budget is 1333 cycles per sample. Status printing belongs in the
 * ~8 ms control loop and nowhere else.
 *
 * ⚠️ It must NOT wait for a host. Blocking on DTR would mean the device does not
 * boot unplugged, which is most of the time.
