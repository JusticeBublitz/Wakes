/*
 * wakes-sp1 — LED rows on hardware PWM, with a tick-driven fade engine.
 *
 * Two rows of four, each on its own nRF PWM peripheral:
 *   TRACK row (PWM2) — above buttons T1-T4. The "model row": Plaits model
 *                      display, and the shutdown animation.
 *   PLAY  row (PWM3) — the side row. The dB meter and the clock.
 *                      Index 0 is the "••" end, index 3 is next to PLAY. The
 *                      hardware channels run the other way; sp1_led.c flips them.
 *
 * Levels are 0-255 PERCEPTUAL, not duty cycle. sp1_led.c applies a gamma table,
 * because perceived brightness is roughly the square of duty and a linear ramp
 * looks wrong -- it appears to rush the bottom end and stall at the top.
 *
 * Why hardware PWM: it costs no CPU. sp1-tape-looper drives these pins as raw
 * GPIO with a software PWM and had to promote its LED timer to a zero-latency
 * IRQ to stop flicker at low duty; that interrupt would compete with the 1333-
 * cycle audio deadline from M2 on. Do not reintroduce software PWM.

 * straight back to sleep. Deferring init makes it structurally impossible, because
