/*
 * wakes-sp1 — the play row (side row) while ON: two layers, composited (M2b).
 *
 * ---- the spec (Adara, M2b) ----
 *   - FOREGROUND: the dB meter while Plaits is selected; the clock while Marbles is.
 *   - BACKGROUND: the other one, capped at SP1_ROW_BG_MAX (~10 %).
 *   - The clock is the old M0 heartbeat -- one LED stepping from the "••" end toward
 *     PLAY -- with the cross-fade REMOVED: a hard step, like a clock. Since M4 it is
 *     Marbles' clock: one step per t2 tick, standing still while stopped.
 *   - The point of the background: the row is never fully dark while the device is
 *     ON, so ON is visible even with every fader at zero and no sound.
 *
 * ---- compositing ----
 * Per LED, the brighter of the two layers wins: out = max(fg, bg). The background is
 * capped at SP1_ROW_BG_MAX, so it only ever shows where the foreground is darker than
 * that -- it can never make a meter reading look louder than it is, except on an LED
 * the meter has left completely dark (or below 10 %).
 *
 * Above 80 % the rule flips (M3): the background DIMS the foreground by up to its own
 * level, fading in from 80 % to 100 %, so the clock stays visible as a notch in a full
 * bar. See composite() in sp1_playrow.c.
 *
 * ---- cost ----
 * Four compares and four sp1_led_set() calls per control tick. The layers are
 * computed whether or not they are in front, so switching foreground is instant and
 * the clock keeps its phase.
 *
 * Nothing here runs in the audio path.
