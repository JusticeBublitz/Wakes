 *  THRESHOLD TABLES — measured on the one SP-1, two sessions a day apart
 *    2026-09-19  logs/sp1-20260919-182353.log  (6-sample means, 20 states)
 *    2026-09-20  logs/sp1-20260920-193610.log  (38/100-sample means, 22 states) <- CURRENT
 *
 *  ---- the model has been tested OUT OF SAMPLE, and held ----
 *  Session 1's fit (A = 3605) was used to MODEL three combinations it had never
 *  seen. Session 2 then measured them for the first time:
 *
 *      T1+T2+T3   predicted 1099   measured 1104   error -5
 *      T1+T2+T4   predicted 1476   measured 1480   error -4
 *      T1+T3+T4   predicted 1626   measured 1628   error -2
 *
 *  Refit on all 13 measured combinations: A = 3604, rms 2.24, worst 4.3 -- the
 *  ceiling moved by one count. The 13 entries still marked "modelled" all contain
 *  PLAY plus two or more buttons; they exist only so those chords are REJECTED.
 *
 *  ---- repeatability ----
 *  19 states measured on both days drift -1 to +3 counts (mean +1.1). Against a
 *  40-count match window that is negligible, but the drift is systematic rather
 *  than random, so re-run calibration if a future session shows it growing.
 *
 *  ⚠️ VALID ONLY UNDER THIS ADC CONFIGURATION: gain 1/6 + ADC_REF_INTERNAL
 *  (0.6 V => 3.6 V full scale), 20 us acquisition, 2x oversampling. sp1-midi's
 *  published tables were taken at gain 1/4 + VDD/4 and are NOT interchangeable.
 *
 *  ---- how these numbers were obtained ----
 *  Five single presses were measured directly. Each button puts its own resistor
 *  in parallel to the divider node, so CONDUCTANCES add and readings do not. With
 *  x = r/(A-r) for a ceiling A, x is additive across pressed buttons and
 *
 *      reading = A * X / (1 + X),    X = sum of the pressed buttons' x
 *
 *  Session 1 fitted A = 3605 on ten combinations; session 2 refitted A = 3604 on
 *  thirteen, after the model had correctly predicted three it had never seen (see
 *  the block at the top). The model is as accurate as the measurement, so the
 *  "modelled" entries are interpolations of a validated curve, not guesses.
 *
 *  ---- what is safe to decode, and what is not ----
 *  Every SINGLE button is at least 53 counts from the nearest other state
 *  (PLAY is the tightest: 1813, between 1755 and 1866; T1 has 189). Its usable
 *  window is -28/+26 against a measured excursion of -5/+8 over 38 samples, so
 *  single-press decoding has a 3x margin at its tightest point.
 *
 *  Combinations are a different story, and this corrects a claim inherited from
 *  the knowledgebase. In the T-only region they separate cleanly (>= 61 counts).
 *  Once PLAY joins, the ladder is already near its ceiling and the states crowd
 *  to 26-55 counts apart. "Eight thresholds each, combinations decodable" is
 *  therefore only half true, and was never measured before now.
 *
 *  So the decoder ACTS on single presses only. Chords are recognised in order to
 *  be IGNORED rather than mistaken for a single -- which is the whole reason the
 *  31-state table exists. The UI does not need chords: "••" is the shift, and it
 *  is a direct GPIO off this rail entirely.
