/*
 * wakes-sp1 — faders and the two button ladders.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LADDER THRESHOLDS CANNOT BE WRITTEN FROM A DESK. They are per-device
 * analog measurements, and the published tables from sp1-midi are only valid under
 * ITS ADC configuration (gain 1/4 + VDD/4), not ours (gain 1/6 + 0.6 V internal).
 * Mixing the two silently produces a table that looks right and misbehaves.
 *
 * It shipped in two stages, the same way the battery divider did, and BOTH ARE NOW
 * DONE:
 *   M1d-a  guided capture (sp1_calib.c) — the firmware names each target and records
 *          the answer against that name, so the table cannot be mis-assembled.
 *   M1d-b  decode. ✅ Tables measured 2026-09-19 from logs/sp1-20260919-182353.log.
 *          See the long comment above the tables in sp1_controls.c for the model
 *          that fills in the combinations, and for why only SINGLE presses are
 *          dispatched.
 *
 * ⚠️ P1.10 (BTN_COM) POWERS BOTH LADDERS AND ALL FOUR FADERS. Until it is driven
 * high, all six channels read ~0 — and that is not a quiet failure, it looks like
 * three unrelated hardware bugs at once (dead faders, dead capture, flickering LEDs
 * from noise on the floating pins). It cost the first M1d-a build. sp1_controls_init()
 * raises it and sp1_power_off() drops it on the way to sleep, so the ON loop calls
 * sp1_controls_rail_on() on entry rather than trusting the last transition.
 *
 * ---- the rail-sag problem ----
 * T1-T4 and Play sit on a resistor ladder fed by a common rail (P1.10) that ALSO
 * feeds the four faders. Pressing any ladder button sags that rail and every fader
 * reading sags with it. So each scan:
 *      1. reads both ladders            (before)
 *      2. reads the four faders
 *      3. reads both ladders again      (after)
 * and marks the fader sample invalid if the rail was loaded at either end. A
 * sustained hold would freeze the faders forever, which is exactly why "••" is the
 * shift and not a track button -- "••" is a direct GPIO, off this rail entirely.
