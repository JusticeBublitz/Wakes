/* ---- position inside a band, linear in dB ----
 * Entry i covers mantissa (i + 0.5) / 128 of the octave, and holds
 *
 *     round(64 * log2(1 + (i + 0.5) / 128))
 *
 * So a peak halfway through a band IN DECIBELS lands at ~32 -- half brightness -- which
 * is what makes equal dB read as equal brightness. Worst-case error 0.08 dB.
 *
 * Why 128 entries and not 32: entry 0 must be exactly 0. At 32 or 64 entries the first
 * centre-sampled value rounds to 1, so a peak sitting EXACTLY on a band edge (every
 * even tone step is one) lit the next LED at 4/255 instead of leaving it dark, and the
 * whole mapping sat slightly high. After the gamma curve that glint is invisible, but a
 * meter that is right only because a rounding error happens to vanish is a meter that
 * skews its bands, which is the one thing the spec asked it not to do. 128 bytes is
 * the price of being right by construction. Top entry is 64, so the top of one band
 * meets the bottom of the next with no gap.
 *
 * ⚠️ GENERATE THIS, do not type it. An earlier, hand-typed 32-entry version had 25
 * wrong entries, off by up to 6 units. Python:
 *   [round(64*math.log2(1+(i+0.5)/128)) for i in range(128)] */
